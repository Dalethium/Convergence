# The Server
The server is built in, basic community rules are don't steal don't grief don't be a dick, disobeying these rules will result in a roll back reversing your changes and immidiate bans. 

Try not to cause lag when others are on, world is pregenned to 16k in all dimensions. 

Do not make me ban chunk loaders for everyone, be fair and only use a max of 2 per group.
