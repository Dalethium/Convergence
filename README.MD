# Installation 
Install MultiMC: https://multimc.org/#Download

Ensure it is installed in a folder on your computer without spaces in the name.

Launch MultiMC

Pick your language and ensure you pick java 8 64 bit if given the option.

Click install pack and install from this zip/link: https://github.com/WeNeedCoffee/Convergence/raw/master/Convergence.zip

Click edit instance

Click launch

Errors can occur, ensure the following list is followed:

Ensure you have java 8 selected in the launcher, click edit instance, then click settings, then go to browse, on most computers if you have launched minecraft before you can find a java 8 install here: ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft\runtime\jre-x64\bin\javaw.exe``

Ensure that, if your java path is not set or correct, that you manually specify it in the launch paramaters, go back to settings, click custom commands, at the very beginning of the line there is ``java -jar``,  replace this with the path you selected earlier surrounded in quotes, so for me I would replace that part of the string with ``"C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft\runtime\jre-x64\bin\javaw.exe" -jar`` 

If it says failed to download, just kill it and relaunch until it succeeds

# The Server
The server is built in, basic community rules are don't steal don't grief don't be a dick, disobeying these rules will result in a roll back reversing your changes and immidiate bans. 

Try not to cause lag when others are on, world is pregenned to 16k in all dimensions. 

Do not make me ban chunk loaders for everyone, be fair and only use a max of 2 per group.
